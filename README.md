# Dim and Measure (auto generate 1 dim (Measur. names) and 4 measu (Lat, Long, num of records, Measu. values)
-Dim: break down aggregated total into smaller totals by category
-Dim only create header. Measure create header+axis

# Discrete and Continuous (green)

# Quantitaive and Qualitative data
-Qualitative: slice quantit., describe or categorize, tell what/when/where, cant perform calc like sum, avg, mean
-Quantitative: provide measurement for qualit., numerical, can perform calc.
Quantit. (usually measure) create axis which show range of values. Qualit. create axis with headers that have labels for categorical data

-can add filter in Data Source window to filter data (Data Source filter)
# Metadata
-Use metadata to create custom names for cols
# Granularity = lvl of detail (LOD)
-Determine LOD: select a mark, right click to view underlying data
# Aggregration = how data is combined
# Join
-join max 32 tables
# Action/ Web Page Object
-A dashboard can have multiple Web page objects.
-To interactively display info from the web inside a dashboard, you can use a URL action with a web page object
